# Email alerts on whatsapp bot 
This project offers a hands-on experience with Twilio WhatsApp chatbot, JavaScript functions, Node.js, and Ngrok - a local system server to run on a global server. It automates sending emails from WhatsApp, which is now one of the most widely used communication channels. The goal is to make life a little easier by building a bot that fetches email details on query. Twilio provides an efficient platform for creating a workflow that queries email data based on a given search criteria and sends their details to WhatsApp. The project utilizes some of Twilio's message, email, call, and notification automation features.
